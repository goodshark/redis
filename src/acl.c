 *              with this user, however the already authenticated connections
 *              will still work.
 * +<command>   Allow the execution of that command
 * -<command>   Disallow the execution of that command
 * +@<category> Allow the execution of all the commands in such category
 *              with valid categories are like @admin, @set, @sortedset, ...
 *              and so forth, see the full list in the server.c file where

 *              via modules.
 * +<command>|subcommand    Allow a specific subcommand of an otherwise
 *                          disabled command. Note that this form is not
 *                          allowed as negative like -DEBUG|SEGFAULT, but
 *                          only additive starting with "+".
 * allcommands  Alias for +@all. Note that it implies the ability to execute
 *              all the future commands loaded via the modules system.
 * nocommands   Alias for -@all.
 * ~<pattern>   Add a pattern of keys that can be mentioned as part of
 *              commands. For instance ~* allows all the keys. The pattern
 *              is a glob-style pattern like the one of KEYS.
 *              It is possible to specify multiple patterns.
 * allkeys      Alias for ~*
 * resetkeys    Flush the list of allowed keys patterns.
 * ><password>  Add this passowrd to the list of valid password for the user.
 *              For example >mypass will add "mypass" to the list.
 *              This directive clears the "nopass" flag (see later).
 * <<password>  Remove this password from the list of valid passwords.
 * nopass       All the set passwords of the user are removed, and the user
 *              is flagged as requiring no password: it means that every
 *              password will work against this user. If this directive is

 *              immediately authenticated with the default user without
 *              any explicit AUTH command required. Note that the "resetpass"
 *              directive will clear this condition.
 * resetpass    Flush the list of allowed passwords. Moreover removes the
 *              "nopass" status. After "resetpass" the user has no associated
 *              passwords and there is no way to authenticate without adding
 *              some password (or setting it as "nopass" later).
 * reset        Performs the following actions: resetpass, resetkeys, off,
 *              -@all. The user returns to the same state it has immediately
 *              after its creation.
 *
 * The 'op' string must be null terminated. The 'oplen' argument should
 * specify the length of the 'op' string in case the caller requires to pass
 * binary data (for instance the >password form may use a binary password).
 * Otherwise the field can be set to -1 and the function will use strlen()
 * to determine the length.
 *
 * The function returns C_OK if the action to perform was understood because
 * the 'op' string made sense. Otherwise C_ERR is returned if the operation
 * is unknown or has some syntax error.
 *
 * When an error is returned, errno is set to the following values:
 *
 * EINVAL: The specified opcode is not understood.
 * ENOENT: The command name or command category provided with + or - is not
 *         known.
 * EBUSY:  The subcommand you want to add is about a command that is currently
